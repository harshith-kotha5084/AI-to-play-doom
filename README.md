# AI-to-play-doom

We build an ai to play the game of doom. the environment used is the Defend The Line-scenario of Vizdoomgym.
we would be using the Deep Convolutional Q Learning
we use convolutional neural networks
we first build brain using convolutional neural networks and then build the body, the make the ai using both
we do the image pre processing and import it into the ai.py 
since our ai learns through experiences and rewards, we use the experience replay to store them
